What experiments to include:

- Matching sum of distances
- Matching longest distance
- Matching mean/median distance

What can be varied: 
- Number of cases
- case/control ratio
- Control selection pool size 
- number features to match on

-- What can improve the tool/paper:

- Vizualization of matching in graph layout (assumming there is an relevant R package) 

- Various calculations:
	- number of possible matchings (i.e., binomial)
	- (log) Probability of finding an equally good/better matching with regards to different metrics 

It would be cool to measure how much signal there is after selecting controls, 
i.e., do an association analysis simulation. 

For instance, we may create data such that cases have higher xyz trait level than controls,
but that it also varies with feature matched confounder variables.

How to generate such data from R is probably going to be complex.

This indicates that the data can be
